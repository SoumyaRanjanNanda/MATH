# 📘 Functions — Identifying Function or Not

## 🔑 Rule to Remember

A relation is a **function** if:

* Each input (**x**) has **exactly one output (y)**.
* If the same input repeats, it must have the **same output**.
* If the same input has **different outputs**, it is **NOT a function**.

### ❓ Question 1

| Input (x) | Output (y) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 2         | 4          |

| 4         | 16         |
| 5         | 25         |

**Answer:** ✅ Function
👉 All inputs are unique, each input maps to exactly one output.

### ❓ Question 2

| Input (x) | Output (y) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | 2          |
| 2         | 3          |
| 2         | 5          |
| 3         | 6          |

**Answer:** ❌ Not a Function
👉 Input `2` is repeated with two different outputs (3 and 5).

### ❓ Question 3

| Input (x) | Output (y) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 7         | 14         |
| 8         | 16         |
| 9         | 18         |
| 10        | 20         |
| 10        | 20         |

**Answer:** ✅ Function
👉 Input `10` repeats, but the output is the same (20), so it is still a function.

## ⚡ Quick Shortcut

* **One input → One output = Function**
* **One input → Many outputs = Not a Function**
