### NEED OF FUNCTIONS ?

* Area = side √ó side
* Cost = price √ó quantity
* Distance = speed √ó time

All are different, but actually the same idea: **output depends on input**.

So mathematicians created **functions** to:

* Make it **simple** (one concept for all).
* Make it **clear** (each input ‚Üí one output).
* Make it **usable** in graphs, equations, programming, AI, etc.

### üîπ Real-Life Examples of Functions

| **Input (x)**     | **Rule (Function)**          | **Output (y = f(x))**  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Side of a square  | $f(x) = x^2$                 | Area of square         |
| Time walked       | $f(x) = 5x$ (speed = 5 km/h) | Distance walked        |
| Chocolates bought | $f(x) = 10x$ (‚Çπ10 each)      | Total cost             |
| Temperature in ¬∞C | $f(x) = (9/5)x + 32$         | Temperature in ¬∞F      |
| Number of items   | $f(x) = x + 2$               | Bill with ‚Çπ2 extra tax |

### üç¶ Ice Cream Example (for Beginners)

1. Suppose you have an **ice cream shop**.

   * 1 ice cream = ‚Çπ20.

2. If someone buys **3 ice creams**, the cost = ‚Çπ60.
   If someone buys **5 ice creams**, the cost = ‚Çπ100.
   If someone buys **10 ice creams**, the cost = ‚Çπ200.

üëâ Every time, you are doing the same calculation:
**Cost = 20 √ó Number of ice creams**

### Why Function Came?

Instead of writing again and again, mathematicians said:
Let‚Äôs make a **rule (function)**:

$$
f(x) = 20x
$$

where $x$ = number of ice creams.

Now, just put input (x) ‚Üí get output.

* Input $x = 3$ ‚Üí $f(3) = 20 \times 3 = 60$.
* Input $x = 5$ ‚Üí $f(5) = 20 \times 5 = 100$.
* Input $x = 10$ ‚Üí $f(10) = 20 \times 10 = 200$.

‚úÖ **So function makes life simple**:

* No need to calculate fresh every time.
* One **rule** covers **all cases**.
* Easy to use in graphs, formulas, and real life.
